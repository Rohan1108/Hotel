Second html css project a bit more advanced and better than the previous one. There is no backend involved so dont try submitting the form in the about section of the website and will surely improve on it as and when I learn new technologies.
Hope you like it and please ignore the text in the website coz it is the one which is inbuilt in vs code and I didnt change it because I am too lazy xDðŸ¥º.
